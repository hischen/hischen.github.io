Hi, I am _@hischen_ (Chen, Xi), a [UCAS](https://www.ucas.edu.cn/) student. My interests range from programming languages in general to deep learning, natural language processing and neural machine translation. 


I studied Electrical Engineering at [Shaanxi University of Science & Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaanxi_University_of_Science_and_Technology) and MS, Computer Science at [University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_the_Chinese_Academy_of_Sciences), with a focus on  natural language processing and neural machine translation.
